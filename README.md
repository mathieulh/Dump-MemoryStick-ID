# Dump-MemoryStick-ID
This dumps the ID of a MemoryStick using a Playstation Portable

Well, there is a way....
This is a little library for the MS we used for some various applications
(Credits to C+D and Booster, and various places i took constants and structs from)
as well as a 1.5 test (you just need to make a PRX for 3.x) application which
reads out the MS Pro attributes to memory stick and shows the MS name and unique ID on the screen
